### Summary
Readmissions to hospitals increase healthcare expenditures and have a negative impact on the reputation of hospitals. Predicting readmissions in the early stages enables for greater attention to be paid to patients who are at high risk of readmission, hence maximizing the healthcare system's efficiency and lowering healthcare costs. Machine learning can assist provide more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. In this work, an approach that balances between feature engineering and machine learning algorithmâ€™s ability to learning representations is proposed for predicting hospital readmission among diabetic patients. Various classification models such as Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNeighbors Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, CatBoost Classifier and Stacking Classifier models are implemented and their performances are analysed on the basis of the model's accuracy score,f1 score, precision and recall values. The best model obtained will be implemented to predict the chances of readmission of diabetic patients within 30 days.


### The output of the project
The project evaluates the best machine learning model which predicts the chances of readmission of diabetic patients within a period of 30 days on the basis of the model's accuracy score,f1 score, precision and recall values. As per the analysis, Catboost Classifier model had the best performance.
